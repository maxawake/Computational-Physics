In order to test the euler and the leapfrog methode, we evaluated the energy and compared the final energy with the initial energy for 3 different eccentricites (in our case we did that in a for-loop with different steps and timeintervalls (stepsizes)). \\
Both methodes satisfy our expectations pretty good, as expected, the relative error of the energy vanishes exponentially as we decrease the stepsize $\Delta t$ logarithmically. 
For further details see the python-code in the appendix.
